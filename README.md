# GifTastic

This is a dynamic page that populates with gifs.

### How it works
*The theme of this page is animals. There is a lists of buttons with different sorts of animals.

*When the user click on a button, 10 gifs related to this animal will be displayed on the page.

*These gifs aren't animated. When the user click on a gif, it becomes animated. If the user click again on that gif, it becomes still again.

*The user can also choose too add another button to the list. To do so, the user will use the form *Add an animal* and click on the *Submit* button. A button with the user choice will be added to the list and a click on it, will display 10 gifs related to the tag on the button.
